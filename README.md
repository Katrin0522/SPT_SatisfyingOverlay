# SPT-SatisfyingOverlay

Because nothing calms you down like a rug being pressure-washed…  
...while you're bleeding out in Interchange.

This mod adds configurable ADHD-style videos (like soap cutting or carpet washing) directly into your SPT-AKI raids.  
Pure visual dopamine, perfect for tactical vibing mid-fight.
